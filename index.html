                I am 25 years old, an Army Veteran and divorced with two Daughters. My daughters names' are Averie, who's three years old and Addysen who is two years old.
                I have been working in the Information Technology field professionally since 2013 where my first position was in the U.S. Army as an Information Technology
                Specialist. From there, I went on to get into Federal contracting for the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers where I held several I.T. related positions that ultimately
                led to me exiting the contracting industry and entering the private industry, where I am currently at as a Systems Administrator for a large I.T. company. Ever 
                since 2009, I began having a lot of interest in software development/programming, so I began my first experience in such with a very minimalistic language known
                as Pawn, which was derived from the C language and used for server creation in a multiplayer mod known as SAMP for GTA: San Andreas. From there, I moved into 
                Software Application development using C# along with various backened languages such as MySQL. After almost ten years of self-taught experience with C#, I decided
                to move into Web Development, which led to me where I am now.
